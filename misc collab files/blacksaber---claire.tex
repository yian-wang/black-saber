\subsection{First general plot, number of workers by gender in each
role}\label{first-general-plot-number-of-workers-by-gender-in-each-role}}

Visually, we can see that as Black Saber grew and hired more people,
there seems to be slightly more women in entry level roles than men. On
the other hand, while we move into the more senior roles, there seems to
be more men. This is something we want to consider and look out for in
our analysis. Is this simply due to chance? Are men in these roles
because they are on average more suited for them by looking into factors
such as productivity and leadership/ Or does Black Saber have a bias
towards promoting men. This plot was made referencing Robert Lanfear's
blog post
\url{https://www.robertlanfear.com/blog/files/visualising_gender_balance_R.html}.

\#Models - using GLM First, we changed the way some of our categorical
factors were encoded into numbers. - something to consider, cant use a
linear model since we have several employees over several years, people
with more years of experience are probably more likely to be promoted
than entry-levels/new employees \#Data Manipulation

\#Using GLM and Logistic Regression to Answer: Are men more likely to be
promoted?

\#Models We will use a Generalized Linear Model with promoted as our
binary response variable.

\hypertarget{salary---combining-yian-and-claires-stuff}{%
\subsection{Salary - combining yian and claire's
stuff}\label{salary---combining-yian-and-claires-stuff}}

this plot tells us, as the company was starting, women and prefer not to
say, on average were making more, however, as we move closer to 2020, we
see men beginning to make more. Is this difference significant?

at first glance the salaries per seniority level per gender is generally
even, though women seem to be less than men\ldots{} let's investigate if
this is significant or not

lol wait why is entry level mean being paid more? We expect to see an
upward trend\ldots{}

We want to investigate whether or not the salaries are fair based on
talent and value\ldots{} The factors we want to use to investigate in
that are the leadership and seniority, and productivity, i think that's
what talent and value are based in right?

Through creating various models to test different fixed and random
effects in our data, we found that gender is a significant fixed effect
in our model (when controlling for other variables that may contribute
to salary). That is we saw that gender does in fact impact the expected
salary we can expect to see from an employee.

More specifically, we can expect to see women and those who have
indicated ``prefer not to say'' under gender making approximately
\[$2248.2\] and \[$1104.1\] less respectively than their male
counterparts.

\item

  approach to ethical statistical consulting. These should be
  appropriately in line with professional conduct advice like the

  or the (Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice from the American

  an ethical statistical consultant would include.}
