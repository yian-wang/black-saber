# General comments (you can delete this section)

_You can delete this section, and if you want to check what it said, just open a template from the package again. You don't have to use this particular template, but you DO need to write you report in RMarkdown and include a cover page._

_The cover page must have:_

*	_A title and subtitle_
* _"Report prepared for Black Saber Software by" your company name_
*	_Date (assessment submission date is fine)_

_You can change the colour of this cover to any colour you would like by replacing 6C3082 in the YAML above (line 11) to another hex code. You could use this tool to help you:_ https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/

# Executive summary

_Guidelines for the executive summary:_

* _No more than two pages_
* _Language is appropriate for a non-technical audience_
* _Bullet points are used where appropriate_
*	_A small number of key visualizations and/or tables are included_
*	_All three research questions are addressed_


\newpage
# Technical report
_This part of the report is much more comprehensive than the executive summary. The audience is statistics/data-minded people, but you should NOT include code or unformatted R output here._


## Introduction

_Provide a brief introduction to your report and outline what the report will cover. This section is valuable for setting scope and expectations. _

### Research questions
_Use bullet points to to describe the research questions you are going to address. Write in full sentences._

## Informative title for section addressing a research question

_For each research question, you will want to briefly describe any data manipulation, show some exploratory plots/summary tables, report on any methods you use (i.e. models you fit) and the conclusions you draw from these_

```{r}
# This chunk provides an example of some things you can do with RMarkdown to make your report creation process easier
#checking github
# read in the data

black_saber_current_employees <- read_csv("data/black-saber-current-employees.csv")

##3 PHASES 
phase1 <- 
  read.csv("data/phase1-new-grad-applicants-2020.csv")
phase2 <- 
  read.csv("data/phase2-new-grad-applicants-2020.csv")
phase3 <- 
  read.csv("data/phase3-new-grad-applicants-2020.csv")

# create a visualisation
my_plot <- black_saber_current_employees %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = productivity)) +
  geom_histogram(colour = "grey", fill = "#6C3082") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Look! A title. But do you want a title or a caption for your report?", x = "This is a changed x label")

# save your plot in your images folder, you can specify the height and width, too
# saving this means you can add the image to your exectuve summary without having to run or rerun the code, if you wish
ggsave("images/example.png", width = 7, height = 4)

# norice how the image is included with the ![](file/path.png) below

## First general plot, number of workers by gender in each role 

```{r, ECHO = TRUE, fig.width= 20, fig.height=30}
roles = c("Entry-level", "Junior I", "Junior II", "Senior I", "Senior II", "Senior III", "Manager", "Director", "Vice president")
promotions <- black_saber_current_employees %>% mutate("role_seniority" = factor(role_seniority, levels = roles)) %>% mutate("order" = as.numeric(role_seniority)/100)

ggplot(data = promotions, aes(x = factor(order), fill = gender)) + 
  geom_bar(data = dplyr::filter(promotions, gender=="Woman")) + geom_bar(data = dplyr::filter(promotions, gender=="Prefer not to say")) +
  geom_bar(data = dplyr::filter(promotions, gender=="Man"),aes(y=..count..*(-1))) + 
  scale_x_discrete(labels = roles) +
  xlab("roles") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme(text = element_text(size=12)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(-100,100,50),labels=abs(seq(-100,100,50))) + 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2") +
  facet_wrap(~financial_q)
```
Visually, we can see that as Black Saber grew and hired more people, there seems to be slightly more women in entry level roles than men. On the other hand, while we move into the more senior roles, there seems to be more men. This is something we want to consider and look out for in our analysis. Is this simply due to chance? Are men in these roles because they are on average more suited for them by looking into factors such as productivity and leadership/ Or does Black Saber have a bias towards promoting men. This plot was made referencing Robert Lanfear's blog post https://www.robertlanfear.com/blog/files/visualising_gender_balance_R.html.

#Models - using GLM 
First, we changed the way some of our categorical factors were encoded into numbers. 
- something to consider, cant use a linear model since we have several employees over several years, people with more years of experience are probably more likely to be promoted than entry-levels/new employees 

```{r,}
#want to count the number of times a person has been promoted 
library(lme4)
promotions <- promotions %>% mutate(gender = factor(gender)) %>% mutate_if(is.factor, as.numeric) %>% group_by(employee_id) %>% mutate("promoted" = '0')
#make role seniority into numbers if id are the same and the next role seniority > than previous add 1 to promo count #(1+gender|seniority) gives us means for seniority 
```
#Separating financial quarters 
```{r,}
#splitting into financial quarters 
promotions_2015Q4<- promotions %>% filter(financial_q == "2015 Q4")

promotions_2016Q1 <- promotions %>% filter(financial_q == "2016 Q1") %>% mutate(promoted = ifelse(role_seniority > promotions_2015Q4$role_seniority, 1, 0))

promotions_2016Q2 <- promotions %>% filter(financial_q == "2016 Q2")
promotions_2016Q3 <- promotions %>% filter(financial_q == "2016 Q3")
promotions_2016Q4 <- promotions %>% filter(financial_q == "2016 Q4")
promotions_2017Q1 <- promotions %>% filter(financial_q == "2017 Q1")
promotions_2017Q2 <- promotions %>% filter(financial_q == "2017 Q2")
promotions_2017Q3 <- promotions %>% filter(financial_q == "2017 Q3")
promotions_2017Q4 <- promotions %>% filter(financial_q == "2017 Q4")
promotions_2018Q1 <- promotions %>% filter(financial_q == "2018 Q1")
promotions_2018Q2 <- promotions %>% filter(financial_q == "2018 Q2")
promotions_2018Q3 <- promotions %>% filter(financial_q == "2018 Q3")
promotions_2018Q4 <- promotions %>% filter(financial_q == "2018 Q4")
promotions_2019Q1 <- promotions %>% filter(financial_q == "2019 Q1")
promotions_2019Q2 <- promotions %>% filter(financial_q == "2019 Q2")
promotions_2019Q3 <- promotions %>% filter(financial_q == "2019 Q3")
promotions_2019Q4 <- promotions %>% filter(financial_q == "2019 Q4")
promotions_2020Q1 <- promotions %>% filter(financial_q == "2020 Q1")
promotions_2020Q2 <- promotions %>% filter(financial_q == "2020 Q2")
promotions_2020Q3 <- promotions %>% filter(financial_q == "2020 Q3")
promotions_2020Q4 <- promotions %>% filter(financial_q == "2020 Q4")


simple <- lm(role_seniority ~ gender, data = promotions)

promo <- lmer(role_seniority ~ (1|employee_id) + gender, data = promotions)


  
```
```{r,}
test <- promotions %>% group_by(employee_id) %>% arrange(financial_q) %>% mutate("promoted" = ifelse(role_seniority > lag(role_seniority, default =  0), 1, 0))
```

```{r,}
#Make different models and compare the difference when adding things like random effects on role seniority 
#also if there is bias, then holding factors like productivity and leadership constant between both genders to our model should produce different results? because holding them constant would mean that for that role, any gender would be suited for the job because they have the same skill set, so gender shouldnt matter 
#could may do a log reg? like calculate the likelihood of men getting promoted vs women? 
#primary response is role_seniority? 
promotions <- promotions %>% mutate("leadership_for_level" = factor(leadership_for_level, levels = c("Needs improvement", "Appropriate for level","Exceeds expectations"))) #changed to factor since we want to look at the levels of leadership on the promotions 


```
#Salary stuff 

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lme4)
promotions <- promotions %>% mutate(salary = str_remove_all(salary,'\\$')) %>% mutate(salary = str_remove_all(salary, ",")) %>% mutate(salary = as.numeric(salary))
##SHOULD MAKE A PLOT - right-skewed dist might be "fixed" by including another variable in the model (LMM)
salary_bygender <- lmer(salary ~ gender + (1|financial_q) +(1|employee_id), data = promotions) 
summary(salary_bygender)
#this tells us that on average, people that have indicated prefer not to say or woman as their gender earn around $3731 and $5596 less respectively. But perhaps productivity and leadership influence this as well - fixed effect 
salary_leadership_productivity <- lmer(salary ~ gender + (1|financial_q) +(1|employee_id) + leadership_for_level + productivity, data = promotions) 
coef(salary_leadership_productivity)

#add random effect on team - perhaps different teams effect salary, 
```

## Discussion

_In this section you will summarize your findings across all the research questions and discuss the strengths and limitations of your work. It doesn't have to be long, but keep in mind that often people will just skim the intro and the discussion of a document like this, so make sure it is useful as a semi-standalone section (doesn't have to be completely standalone like the executive summary)._

### Strengths and limitations

# Consultant information
## Consultant profiles

*Complete this section with a brief bio for each member of your group. If you are completing the project individually, you only need to complete one for yourself. In that case, change the title of this section to 'Consultant profile' instead. Examples below. This section is only marked for completeness, clarity and professionalism, not 'truth' so you can write it as if we're a few years in the future. Put your current degree in as completed and/or add your first choice grad school program, whatever you like. What skills related skills would you most like to highlight? What job title do you want?*

## Code of ethical conduct

_This section should be fairly short, no more than half a page. Assume a general audience, much like your executive summary._

* _Make at least three relevant statements about your company’s approach to ethical statistical consulting. These should be appropriately in line with professional conduct advice like the (Statistical Society of Canada Code of Conduct)[https://ssc.ca/sites/default/files/data/Members/public/Accreditation/ethics_e.pdf] or the (Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice from the American Statistical Society)[https://www.amstat.org/ASA/Your-Career/Ethical-Guidelines-for-Statistical-Practice.aspx]. For example, "the customer is always right" ISN’T the type of thing an ethical statistical consultant would include._
*	_Be very careful not to just copy and paste from these other documents! Put things in your own words._
